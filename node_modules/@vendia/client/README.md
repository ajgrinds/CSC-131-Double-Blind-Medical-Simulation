# @vendia/client - a type-safe client for Vendia Share

The Client SDK is a type-safe **TypeScript & JavaScript** client for your Uni's API with **auto-generated code customized to match your Uni's schema!**

If you're new to Vendia and wondering what a "Uni" is? This is a great place to start: [What is a Uni?](https://www.vendia.com/docs/share/dev-and-use-unis).

The official Vendia client is the easiest way to start working with your Uni. Enjoy autocomplete (intellisense) in your favorite IDE, built-in support for both HTTP and websocket GraphQL APIs (see [Realtime Data](#realtime-data-graphql-subscriptions)), multiple authentication methods, file upload/download, and additional conveniences. The client is _[isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_JavaScript)_ â€” it can be used in both the **browser** and **server (node.js)**.

**What does "auto-generated code" mean?**

Code based on your Uni's schema will be generated automatically during installation (you can read more about how it works [in the appendix below](#code-generation-details)). If your schema included a "product" entity, for example, your generated client would include the following methods:

```tsx
// List all the products
const listProductsResponse = await client.entities.product.list();

// Add a new product
const addProductResponse = await client.entities.product.add({
  name: 'super-widget',
  inventory: 100,
});

// Get a product by ID
const getProductResponse = await client.entities.product.get('abc-123');
```
